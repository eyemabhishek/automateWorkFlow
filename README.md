## Introduction

The "automateWorkflow" project streamlines the deployment process for your live running app. With this setup, developers can commit their code changes, and the deployment to the live app will be automatically triggered.

## Getting Started

To get started with the automated deployment workflow, ensure you have the following:



## How It Works

The automated deployment workflow is powered by [mention the tools or services used for deployment automation]. It monitors the main branch of this repository for new code commits. When a developer pushes code to the main branch, the following steps occur:

1.Automated tests are executed to ensure code quality.
2.Code is packaged and prepared for deployment.
3.Deployment script is triggered to update the live app.

The entire process ensures that your live app remains up to date with the latest code changes.
